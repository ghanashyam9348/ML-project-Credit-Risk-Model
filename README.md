## Project Overview

Credit risk modeling is crucial for banks and other lenders to minimize financial losses. This project applies various machine learning algorithms to historical loan data to classify borrowers into risk categories (e.g., "default" or "non-default").

**Objectives:**
- Analyze and preprocess credit data.
- Explore various machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).
- Evaluate models for accuracy, recall, precision, and ROC AUC.
- Deploy the best-performing model for inference.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training, validation, and hyperparameter tuning
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Prediction on new/unseen data
- Modular code for reproducibility and scalability

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ghanashyam9348/ML-project-Credit-Risk-Model.git
   cd ML-project-Credit-Risk-Model
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

- **Data Preparation:**  
  Place your dataset in the `data/` directory. Update the data loading scripts as needed.

- **Run Jupyter Notebooks:**  
  Explore the workflow and analysis via `notebooks/`.  
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook
  ```

- **Model Training:**  
  Use scripts in `src/` to preprocess data and train models. Example:
  ```bash
  python src/model_training.py
  ```

- **Model Evaluation:**  
  Evaluate models using provided scripts or notebooks.

- **Prediction:**  
  Use the best model to predict credit risk on new data.

## Model Training & Evaluation

- Supports multiple algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.
- Uses cross-validation and grid/randomized search for hyperparameter tuning.
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC AUC.

## Results

Detailed results, including confusion matrices, ROC curves, and feature importances, are stored in the `results/` directory.  
Refer to the notebooks for visualization and interpretation.
